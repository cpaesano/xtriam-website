Job Costing Impact:

To see how chargebacks affect your job costing:

Step 1: Open Accounting Package
- Click on "Accounting Package" in the Sales Document Navigator
- Scroll down to the "Job Costing" section

Step 2: Review Job Costing Adjustments
The report shows:
- Original Commissionable Cost
- Chargeback amounts
- Adjusted Commissionable Cost
- Original Markup
- Adjusted Markup
- Base Price
- Customer Price

Example:
- Products + Mats Original Cost: $23,808.25
- Chargeback: $1,450.00
- Adjusted Cost: $25,258.25
- Original Markup: 50.00%
- Adjusted Markup: 41.39%

Step 3: View Commission Impact
The Adjusted Sales Commission Breakdown shows:
- Original Sales Commission %
- Adjusted Sales Commission %
- Original Cost Basis
- Adjusted Cost Basis
- Original Sales Commission amount
- Adjusted Sales Commission amount

---

Understanding the Numbers:

When you add a chargeback:
1. The Commissionable Cost increases
2. The Markup percentage decreases (since customer price stays the same)
3. Sales Commission may be adjusted based on the new cost basis
4. Total Profit decreases by the chargeback amount

Example Impact:
- Original Quote Cost: $30,408.25
- Chargeback: $1,450.00
- Adjusted Quote Cost: $31,858.25
- Original Sales Comm: $4,885.36
- Adjusted Sales Comm: $4,528.24
