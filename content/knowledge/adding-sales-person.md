Adding a New Sales Person in bpmPro

Overview:
This guide shows how to add a new sales person to bpmPro. Sales people are created as Contacts under your company's Account record with specific employee settings.

---

Step-by-Step Guide:

Step 1: Search for Your Company
- Click on the Search bar at the top of the page
- Type your company name (e.g., "Window Dealer")
- Click on your company's Account record from the search results

Step 2: Navigate to Contacts Tab
- In the Account Workspace, click on the "Contacts" tab
- This shows all contacts associated with your company

Step 3: Create New Contact
- Click the "New" button to create a new contact

Step 4: Enter Contact Information
Fill in the following fields:
- First Name: Employee's first name (e.g., "Mary")
- Last Name: Employee's last name (e.g., "Kellog")
- Title: Their job title (e.g., "Sales Rep")

Step 5: Set Category to Employee
- Click on the "Category" dropdown
- Select "Employee" from the list
- This identifies the contact as an employee rather than a customer or vendor

Step 6: Enter Contact Details
- Mobile: Employee's mobile phone number (e.g., "561-444-1234")
- Email: Employee's email address (e.g., "marykellog@window-dealer.com")

Step 7: Configure Employee Internal Setup (CRITICAL)
This section makes the employee appear in Sales Person dropdowns:

- Internal Company Role: Click the dropdown and select "Sales and Estimating"
- Company Role Active: CHECK this box

IMPORTANT: Both settings are required for the employee to appear in Sales Person dropdowns throughout bpmPro.

Step 8: Save
- Click "Save" to create the contact
- The new sales person will now be available for assignment

Why Company Role Active Matters:

The "Company Role Active" checkbox:
- Must be checked for the employee to appear in dropdowns
- Can be unchecked to hide inactive employees from dropdowns
- Does not delete the contact, just hides them from selections

---

Editing Existing Contacts:

To update an existing contact to be a Sales Person:

Step 1: Find the Contact
- Navigate to your company's Account
- Go to the Contacts tab
- Find the contact in the list

Step 2: Edit the Contact
- Click the dropdown arrow next to the contact
- Select "Edit"

Step 3: Update Settings
- Change Category to "Employee"
- Set Internal Company Role to "Sales and Estimating"
- Check "Company Role Active"

Step 4: Save
- Click "Save" to update the contact

---

Common Issues:

"Sales Person Not Showing in Dropdowns":
- Verify Internal Company Role is set to "Sales and Estimating"
- Verify "Company Role Active" checkbox is checked
- Ensure the contact is saved after making changes

"Need to Remove Sales Person from Dropdowns":
- Uncheck the "Company Role Active" checkbox
- This hides them from dropdowns without deleting the contact

"Duplicate Contact Warning":
- Check if the employee already exists as a contact
- Edit the existing contact instead of creating a duplicate

Tips:
- Always set the Category to "Employee" for staff members
- Use "Sales and Estimating" role for anyone who should appear as a Sales Person
- Keep the "Company Role Active" checkbox checked for active employees
- Uncheck "Company Role Active" when an employee leaves (instead of deleting)
- Enter mobile and email for each sales person for communication features
