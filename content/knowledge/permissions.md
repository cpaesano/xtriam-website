Permissions & Access

Overview:
bpmPro uses role-based permissions to control what users can see and do. Understanding your access level helps you work efficiently and know when to request additional permissions.

Understanding Roles:
- Sales Rep: Own accounts, quotes, projects
- Sales Manager: Team's accounts, reports, approvals
- Admin: Full system access, configuration
- Executive: View all data, dashboards, reports

What Determines Your Access:
Your access depends on:
- Your assigned role/profile
- Record ownership (who created or owns the record)
- Sharing rules set by admin
- Team membership

Common Access Issues:

"Insufficient Privileges":
What it means: You don't have permission for this action.
Solutions:
- Contact your manager to request access
- Ask the record owner to share with you
- Admin may need to update your profile

"Record Not Found":
What it means: The record exists but isn't shared with you.
Solutions:
- Ask the owner to share the record
- Request your manager to grant access
- Contact admin if you should have access

"Cannot Edit Record":
What it means: You have read-only access.
Reasons:
- Record may be locked
- You only have view permissions
- Record is owned by someone else
- Approval process has locked the record

Requesting Access:

How to Request:
1. Identify exactly what you need access to
2. Contact your manager with: What record/feature you need, Why you need access, How often you'll use it
3. Manager contacts admin
4. Admin updates your permissions

For Administrators:

Access is managed through:
- Profiles: Base permissions for user types
- Permission Sets: Additional permissions on top of profile
- Sharing Rules: Who can see which records
- Role Hierarchy: Data access inheritance

Common Admin Tasks:

Adding a Permission Set:
1. Go to Setup, then Permission Sets
2. Create or select existing
3. Assign to users

Updating Sharing Rules:
1. Go to Setup, then Sharing Settings
2. Create sharing rule
3. Define criteria and access level

Tips:
- Document why you need access when requesting
- Don't share your login credentials with others
- Report any suspicious access issues
- Review your access needs periodically
